# Pro Zoom

Allows scopes to be disabled and tracks zoom levels for players.

Interacting with the plugin is accomplished via natives.  By itself this plugin will just track zoom levels in the background and is not very useful.

Only works with: awp, scout, sg550, and the g3sg1 (the others require dhooks to work and thus not implemented yet).
